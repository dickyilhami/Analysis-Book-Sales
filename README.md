# Analysis-Book-Sales

Sales analysis shows data in the form of a company's sales trend for a certain duration. The most basic form of a sales analysis report can show an increase or decrease in sales figures.

The purpose of this analysis is to display the number of book sales for each area (district). From the results of this analysis, it is hoped that it can be used to optimize book inventory.

This analysis process is intended to display an analysis of book sales per area, so there are several important things that need to be considered, namely in the given dataset there is no city name column, so it is necessary to extract the city name from the address column. After this is done, the analysis process is carried out. 

In this project, I as an analyst use several tools for the analysis process, namely by using python for profiling and cleansing data and taking features related to what is being analyzed. for bi tools used is google data studio. here I show the capture dashboard that has been made.
